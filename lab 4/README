where the values, in order, should be:

- job mix (values 1 or 4) 
- references per process

** NOTE **
Inputs 14 and 16 take a really long time to finish (like 7 minutes). I'm not sure why that is, but the results are correct, so if you could wait for them to finish, I promise they do!! I couldn't figure out how to fix it in time. Thank you and sorry.
