This program accepts arguments through a file.

Navigate to the correct path in which the program files are and execute:
> javac Banker.java

To run this program, execute:
> java Banker <input-filename>

where the <input-filename> includes the file extension .txt

For the purpose of testing and debugging, I added a --verbose flag that prints the detailed output. I left my code for that in the program, so you could also execute the following if you want the detailed output:

> java Banker --verbose <input-filename>
