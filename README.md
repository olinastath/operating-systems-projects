# Operating Systems Projects

### Information about the class

This repository contains all the projects I worked on for my Operating Systems class, UA-CSCI 202 with Professor Gottlieb in Spring 2017. We had the liberty of choosing the language in which we wanted to complete them and I chose Java. In each folder titled "lab #" you will find:
* a "sample io" folder which contains test inputs and their desired outputs
* a pdf file which contains the provided instructions
* a README file, which contains instructions for running the program
* a single .java file named after the assignment
* a random-numbers.txt file, in some projects

### Running the projects

To run these projects, you will have to download the .java and .txt files and follow the instructions in the README of the lab to run them. You can use the provided IO to test out the code.

### Breakdown of each lab

#### Lab 1: Linker Lab
The objective of this lab was to simulate linking, relocating relative addresses and resolving external references depending on the type of address in the input.

#### Lab 2: Scheduling Lab
The objective of this lab was to simulate scheduling in order to see how the time required depends on the scheduling algorithm
and the request patterns. The scheduling algorithms I implemented are FCFS, RR with quantum 2, LCFS, and SRTN.

#### Lab 3: Banker Lab
The objective of this lab was to simulate resource allocation using both an optimistic resource manager and the banker's algorithm.

#### Lab 4: Paging Lab
The objective of this lab was to simulate demand paging and see how the number of page faults depends on page size, program size, replacement algorithm, and job mix.
