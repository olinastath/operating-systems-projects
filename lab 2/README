This program accepts arguments through a file.

Navigate to the correct path in which the program files are and execute:

> javac Scheduling.java


There are multiple ways of running this program:

> java Scheduling <input-filename>
This will prompt the user to select a type of sorting algorithm and will keep requesting one if it is not one of the given options. It will then execute the algorithm on the input file.

> java Scheduling <type-of-algorithm> <input-filename>
This will execute the specified type of sorting algorithm on the input file. Possible types are FCFS, RR, LCFS, and PSJF. If the type is misspelled, a prompt will show up and ask the user to input the type of sorting algorithm to use into the console.


> java Scheduling --verbose <input-filename>
> java Scheduling --verbose <type-of-algorithm> <input-filename>
These commands will work the same way as specified above, but the --verbose flag will print the detailed output instead of just the summary.
